# OpenFW (STABLE)
### This is the STABLE branch, and only includes versions of my scripts that have been tested enough for stability and performance to be considered stable.

## What is OpenFW?
OpenFW is a GitHub repository featuring both stable and unstable Open Source Free Use Scripts that you are free to download and reuse/modify in your own games.

## What do I have to do in order to use the scripts?
Please, only merely credit me somewhere in your game that is easily accessible to all players. I ask of nothing more.
